**Today's Progress**: Planned, what to learn in this challenge.

**Thoughts:** I really want to learn Full-Stack Web Development but i am bit lack in the Frameworks and also lack on knowledge in Javascript. So, i am Learning JavaScript from material \***\*You Don't Know JS\*\*** by author [Kyle Simpson](http://getify.me/).

**Link to Material:** [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS.git)
